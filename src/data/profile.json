  "bio": "I'm a Full-Stack Software Engineer with 2 years of experience building enterprise-grade applications. I hold a Master's degree in High Performance Computing and Big Data Analysis, which fuels my passion for building performant, data-driven solutions.\n\nCurrently working at .msg Systems Romania on a Mercedes-Benz Group AG project, where I develop and integrate complex systems using Spring Boot, Angular, and modern cloud technologies. I thrive at the intersection of backend architecture and intuitive frontend experiences.\n\nOutside of work I'm usually cooking something new, going down a rabbit hole about cars, staring at the night sky, or making a decent cup of coffee — sometimes all in the same evening.",
